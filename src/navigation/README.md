- As the name suggests, all the routing logic resides here.
- Our app uses “react-router-dom” for routing implementation.
- Mainly 2 types of routes are included, public & private, where private being the ones that require authentication.
- “RouterConfig.js” will have all the routes of the application defined within at one place.
- “PrivatRoute.js” is a component to add a check for user authentication for secure/private routes.
- CONSTANTS.js consists of all the constants for various available routes within our app. Reason is simply to avoid typos and easy renaming of routes when required.
